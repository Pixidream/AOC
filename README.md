# 🎄 Advent of Code

This repository contains my attempts at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, starting from 2025.

> **Note:** This README was generated with AI assistance. Github workflows as well. All code solutions are my own work. I don't want to spend time with anything not related to AOC.

## 📅 Years

- [**2025**](./2025) - In progress...

## 🦀 Language

I'm using **Rust** to solve these challenges. It's a great opportunity to learn and practice the language!

## 📂 Structure

```

Each day is an independent Rust project with its own `Cargo.toml`.

## 🚀 Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd 2025/01
cargo run
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 📝 Notes

These solutions represent my own attempts and learning process. They may not be optimal, but they work (hopefully)! 😄
