## 📝 Personal Notes

### Day 1
Day 1 was a surprisingly refreshing warm-up.
The puzzle forced me to wake up parts of my brain I hadn’t used in a long time:

Arithmetic that I hadn’t touched in years suddenly mattered again.

I had to translate English to French more carefully — the phrase “left pointing at 0” almost sent me down the wrong path.

The problem description was trickier than expected, and it made me pay real attention to wording, edge cases, and reasoning through examples.

From a Rust perspective, this day was a great re-entry into the language:

I revisited parsing patterns, error handling, FromStr, and numeric operations.

I explored small but useful tools like rem_euclid, checked_add, and working with slices for manual parsing.

I set up proper benches using Criterion, automated the results into my README.

Overall, this day reminded me how fun it is to mix math, careful reading, and Rust’s rigor. A perfect “brain stretch” to start the month.
